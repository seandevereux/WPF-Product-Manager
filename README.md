# WPF-Product-Manager
This small project was made to handle products as my friend challenged me to create a small app that did so. I may continue working on this however this wasn't created with the scope of any large scope in mind. currently can manually add and edit items, remove items by quantity

Changelog 30/11/23
Bugfixes for editing items
Bugfixes for inventory item selection (selected index value of each inventory list remains the same when clicking through items)
Bugfixes for create item (removed item descriptions / removed because barcode items do not come with a description)
UI tweaks

If i do continue developing this app I will add an item loader from json file or database & append to json file or database from barcode & price selection. I learned that barcode scanners simply paste a value onto the selected input field, so to make this program operational all i would need to do is create an "add item list" user interface, one field for name & on paste select next field, one field for price where you obviously have to type a value and a button to add to list, a remove from list button, an edit button & an append to file button. & then also handle sales in another application, create a database. However for now I will only work on this in my spare time.
